<p align='justify'> The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Despite recent progress on related vision-language tasks and benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in real-world tasks. To empower embodied agents with the ability to interact with humans, in this work, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate our model on the TEACH vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that ELBA achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities.  </p>
